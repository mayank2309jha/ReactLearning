React is a Javascript library, which is used to create frontend of websites.

We will treat every object on the screen as a separate component and we will add styles and functionalities to them individually.
This will allow us to make customised changes to each component without harming the other elements on the screen.

This will help us make our designs more responsive and more interactive.

We will use react in index.js file.
This file will require react and reactDom to use react library.

we will create a JSX element which appears to be an HTML tag and use it to show HTML properties on the webpage.
