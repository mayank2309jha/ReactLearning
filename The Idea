React is a Javascript library, which is used to create frontend of websites.

We will treat every object on the screen as a separate component and we will add styles and functionalities to them individually.
This will allow us to make customised changes to each component without harming the other elements on the screen.

This will help us make our designs more responsive and more interactive.
