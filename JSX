When we use react in index.js file it can be used as a JSX file and we can use text that seems like HTML along with vanilla javascript.

So we can use variables like.

let name = "Mayank";

ReactDom.render(
<div>
  <h1>Hello I am {name}</h1>
</div>,
document.getElementById("root"))


When you place some text inside a bracket like this the compiler interprets this text as a javascript code and treats it as such.

Not only can we add variables inside the {} we can also add some javascript expression in between {}.

But we cannot write javascript statements like if - else statements.
